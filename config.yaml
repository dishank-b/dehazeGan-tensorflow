            Experiment 2
            Generator have alternate skip connections. i.e in_img-conv2=>conv3, conv1-conv3=>conv4, conv2-conv4=>conv5 
            Numbers of feature map are in order of 8, 16, 32, 64, 3
            Batch Norm is used in conv 2,3,4
            No transMap inforamtion is used
            No deconv is used
            No loss other than adversarial loss and L1 loss is used.
            Discriminator is taken from pix2pix-affiine_layer with some changes in no. of feature_maps
            All hyper parameters same as used in my_pix2pix, only the changes is made in gen and Discriminator
            No weight regularization
