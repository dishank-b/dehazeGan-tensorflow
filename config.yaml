            Experiment 3
            Generator have a U-net with 3 enc and 3 deconv
            Numbers of feature map are in order of 16,256,512 - Veru high
            Batch Norm is used in last two enc and first two dec
            No transMap inforamtion is used
            No loss other than adversarial loss and L1 loss is used.
            Discriminator is taken from pix2pix-affiine_layer with some changes in no. of feature_maps
            All hyper parameters same as used in my_pix2pix, only the changes is made in gen and Discriminator
            No weight regularization
